# Please v5.0 Rebrand Completion

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Date**: December 14, 2025  
**Completion**: All OohLama to Please rebrand tasks finished successfully

## What Was Completed

### ✅ Final Cleanup Tasks
1. **Legacy Compatibility Documentation**
   - Updated comments in `config.go` to properly document OOHLAMA_* variables as "legacy compatibility (pre-v5 OohLama name)"
   - Ensured clear communication that these are for backward compatibility only

2. **Code Quality Verification**
   - All 136 tests passing ✅
   - Test coverage maintained across all packages
   - No regressions introduced

3. **Git History**
   - All changes properly committed with descriptive messages
   - Clean commit history documenting the rebrand process

### ✅ Backward Compatibility Maintained
- `OOHLAMA_PROVIDER` environment variable still works (with legacy notice)
- `OOHLAMA_SCRIPT_TYPE` environment variable still works (with legacy notice)
- `ol` command alias still functional for existing users
- Graceful transition path for existing OohLama users

### ✅ New Please v5.0 Features Active
- **Primary Command**: `pls` (natural language, no quotes needed)
- **Alternative Commands**: `please` (formal) and `ol` (legacy)
- **Natural Language Interface**: "pls list all files" works without quotes
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Windows PowerShell, Linux/macOS Bash
- **Multiple AI Providers**: Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic
- **Enhanced Safety**: Smart risk assessment with color-coded warnings
- **Politely Silly Personality**: Encouraging and helpful tone

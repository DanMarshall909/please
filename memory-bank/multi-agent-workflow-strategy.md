## üîÑ **OPTIMAL DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW**

### **Phase-Based Agent Coordination**

```
1. STRATEGIC PLANNING (CLINE)
   - Analyze current project state
   - Define implementation priorities
   - Update AGENTS.md with current focus
   - Set success criteria and quality gates

2. AUTONOMOUS IMPLEMENTATION (CODEX)
   - Deep focus on single objective (2-3 hours)
   - TDD approach with comprehensive testing
   - Follow Result<T> pattern architecture
   - Commit working increments

3. REVIEW & COORDINATION (CLINE)
   - Validate implementation against requirements
   - Update progress tracking in memory-bank
   - Plan next development phase
   - Document lessons learned

4. CYCLE REPETITION
   - Each cycle builds on previous success
   - Clear handoff points between agents
   - Incremental progress toward C# migration
```

### **Communication Protocols**

**üìã Documentation-Driven Handoffs**:
- `AGENTS.md` - Primary coordination document
- `memory-bank/strategic-testing-c#-migration-progress.md` - Progress tracking
- Commit messages - Clear completion and handoff signals
- Global `.clinerules` - Consistent behavior enforcement

**üéØ Clear Responsibility Boundaries**:
- **CODEX**: Implementation, testing, TDD cycles, technical execution
- **CLINE**: Strategy, coordination, documentation, review, quality gates

## üß† **dRAGster INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE**

### **Please + dRAGster Philosophy**
**Please Core Concept**: Command-heavy, query-light philosophy
- "please find me all files greater than 10kb"
- "please delete all backup files"
- "please compress all logs from last week"

**dRAGster Enhancement**: Intelligent context gathering before script generation

### **Integration Workflow**
```
USER COMMAND: "please find files larger than 10kb"
    ‚Üì
1. Please Command Parsing
   - Extract intent: FIND + FILES + SIZE_CRITERIA
   - Identify context needs: location, format, filters
    ‚Üì
2. dRAGster Context Retrieval
   - Query: "file search patterns for this user"
   - Retrieve: preferred locations, output formats, exclusions
   - Return: intelligent defaults and best practices
    ‚Üì
3. Enhanced Script Generation
   - Generate script with learned preferences
   - Apply user-specific patterns and safety checks
   - Include intelligent defaults from context
    ‚Üì
4. Learning Loop
   - Store successful patterns in dRAGster
   - Update user preference models
   - Improve future command intelligence
```

### **Technical Integration Points**

**Core Please Architecture** (to be built by CODEX):
```csharp
public interface IContextService
{
    Task<Result<CommandContext>> GetContextAsync(CommandIntent intent);
    Task<Result> StorePatternAsync(CommandExecution execution);
}

public class CommandProcessor
{
    private readonly IContextService _dragsterService;
    private readonly IScriptGenerator _generator;

    public async Task<Result<ScriptResponse>> ProcessAsync(string command)
    {
        var intent = ParseCommand(command);
        var context = await _dragsterService.GetContextAsync(intent);
        return _generator.Generate(intent, context);
    }
}
```

## üöÄ **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

### **Phase 1: Foundation (CODEX Implementation)**
**Goal**: Complete C# Result pattern migration  
**CODEX Tasks**:
- [ ] Result<T> pattern implementation with comprehensive tests
- [ ] Strongly typed IDs with validation

## üí° **DOGFOODING STRATEGY FOR dRAGster**

### **Perfect Use Cases**:
1. **Command Pattern Learning**: "User typically searches ~/Documents when looking for large files"
2. **Safety Enhancement**: "User prefers confirmation before bulk deletions"
3. **Intelligent Defaults**: "User always excludes node_modules from searches"
4. **Best Practice Injection**: "Add error handling for network operations"

### **Measurable Benefits**:
- Reduced command typing (intelligent defaults)
- Fewer errors (learned safety patterns)
- Faster script generation (cached patterns)
- Progressive improvement over time
